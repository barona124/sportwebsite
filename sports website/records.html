A first-round meeting between the American number 23 seed John Isner and the French qualifier Nicolas Mahut was not high on the wish lists of many of the Wimbledon crowd on a Tuesday afternoon in June 2010.

But after 183 games, more than 100 aces and 11 hours of playing time, a mass of spectators flocked to court 18 to watch Isner close out the final set 70-68 on the Thursday evening.

It wasn't all bad for Mahut, though. Both players were presented with a crystal bowl and crystal champagne flutes by the All England Club to mark the longest tennis match in history.

Few people suspected Arsenal would lose their final game of the 2003-04 campaign, even when Paul Dickov gave Leicester a half-time lead at Highbury.

The Gunners had gone 37 games unbeaten through the season, and the inevitable second-half turnaround thanks to goals from Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira eventually saw Arsenal over the line to become 'Invincibles' - the first team since Preston North End in 1889 to go a full league campaign without losing.

Their run continued into the following season, but Arsene Wenger's side's eventually came unstuck at Old Trafford, 49 games after their last defeat.

Michael Phelps's four gold medals in the Aquatics Centre at London 2012 took him to 18 golds for his career - double the number held by any other individual.

At his first Olympics in Athens in 2004, the American won six golds and two bronze medals. Since then he has gone on to dominate men's individual competition in the pool, winning 22 medals in all.

At the 2008 Games in Beijing, Phelps's eight-gold haul was the most won in a single Olympics by one athlete - just one of the number of records held by this supreme swimmer. His recent decision to revoke his retirement will strike fear into 2016 medal hopefuls.

It was just two hours into day three of the Windies' Test against England in Antigua when Lara drew his knock to a close by declaring with the home side at 751-5.

And it was certainly no fluke from Lara, who had broken the record 10 years earlier with a 375 against England. He also holds the record for the highest first-class innings - a 501 not out for Warwickshire against Durham in 1994.

Wilkinson's left foot, and right foot for that matter, have been the difference for England on many occasions in Rugby World Cups.

It was, of course, instrumental in helping England win the tournament in 2003.

The now retired fly-half unsurprisingly holds the record for the most points (277), drop goals (14) and penalties (58) scored in Rugby World Cup tournaments, and he recently proved he can deliver team talks in two languages, as well as kick points off both feet.

The Jamaican cruised to gold in the 100m and 200m in London, and was just 0.05 seconds off beating his world record 100m time of 9.58, set in Berlin in 2009.

In September, Bolt declared he can shave even more time off his records.

"One of my biggest goals is to try to run sub-19 [in 200m]," he said. "Pushing the barrier a little bit will be great for me."
